# Contributor Dependency Graph and Ownership Map

This document describes subsystem ownership, service boundaries, data owners,
and escalation paths for the xConfess monorepo.  It is the human-readable
companion to [.github/CODEOWNERS](../.github/CODEOWNERS), which drives
GitHub's automatic reviewer assignment.

## How to read this document

- **Owner** — the GitHub user or team responsible for a subsystem.  They are
  the first point of contact for reviews, incidents, and questions.
- **Escalation** — who to contact when the primary owner is unavailable or the
  change spans multiple subsystems.
- **Data sensitivity** — whether the subsystem touches PII, secrets, or
  on-chain state.

## Escalation Paths

1. **Primary owner unavailable** — open a GitHub issue and tag `@yazeed11011`
   directly.  Include the affected subsystem and urgency level.
2. **Security incident** (secrets exposed, auth bypass, on-chain exploit) —
   contact `@yazeed11011` immediately via the contact details in the private
   security policy.  Do **not** post details publicly.
3. **Cross-cutting change** (touches ≥ 2 subsystems) — request review from
   `@yazeed11011` and add a PR comment listing the affected subsystems.
4. **Contract upgrade** — follow
   [docs/contract-release-and-upgrade-runbook.md](contract-release-and-upgrade-runbook.md).
   Requires maintainer sign-off before any testnet or mainnet deploy.

## Stale Ownership Detection

The CODEOWNERS file should be reviewed at the start of each Stellar Wave.
Ownership is considered **stale** if:

- The listed owner has not merged a PR in the relevant subsystem for 60+ days.
- The subsystem has grown substantially and no secondary owner is named.

To update ownership:
1. Open a PR that edits `.github/CODEOWNERS` and this document.
2. Get sign-off from the current owner (or a maintainer if the owner is
   unreachable).
3. Announce the change in the PR description so contributors can re-subscribe.

The `npm run diagnose` output includes a `git log` summary per subsystem that
can help identify inactive areas.
