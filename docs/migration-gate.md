# Database Migration Gating

This document describes the migration safety gate for xConfess CI and
deployments, implemented as part of issue #129.

## Overview

The migration gate (`scripts/migration-gate.js`) runs in CI and before every
deployment to catch unsafe or broken migrations before they reach a live
database.

## Checks performed

### 1. Duplicate timestamp detection

TypeORM orders migrations by their numeric timestamp prefix.  Two migrations in
the same directory with identical leading digits will run in an undefined order,
which can cause silent schema corruption.

- **Full timestamps** (13+ digits, e.g. `1774790298268`): duplicates in the
  same directory are always a hard failure.
- **Date-only prefixes** (e.g. `20260126`): pre-existing in the repo; treated
  as a warning only.  New migrations should use a full timestamp or a
  `yyyymmddHHMMSS` format to avoid ambiguity.

### 2. up() / down() presence

Every migration must provide both an `up` method (forward change) and a `down`
method (rollback).  If the rollback is genuinely irreversible, the `down()`
should throw an `Error` explaining why rather than being omitted.

### 3. Destructive DDL in up()

The following operations in an `up()` method are flagged as requiring review:

- `DROP COLUMN` — removing a column loses data
- `DROP TABLE` — removing a table loses data
- `TRUNCATE` — truncating a table loses data

**Preferred approach (expand/contract):**

1. Add the new column/table in one migration (expand).
2. Deploy the new application version that reads/writes both old and new.
3. In a follow-up migration, remove the old column/table (contract).

This allows the previous app version to continue operating during the deploy
window without schema incompatibilities.

**If a destructive migration is intentional and reviewed:**

Add the acknowledgement comment to the top of the migration file:

```typescript
// @unsafe-migration-acknowledged
// Rationale: <explain why this is safe>
```

Or set `ALLOW_UNSAFE_MIGRATIONS=true` when running the gate (CI only; do not
use in production deploy scripts).

## Running the gate

```bash
# Normal run — fails the build on errors
node scripts/migration-gate.js

# Or via npm script
npm run migration:gate

# Dry-run — prints findings but exits 0 (for reporting without blocking)
npm run migration:gate:dry-run

# Allow pre-reviewed unsafe migrations (use sparingly)
ALLOW_UNSAFE_MIGRATIONS=true node scripts/migration-gate.js
```

## CI integration

The gate runs as the `migration-gate` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`,
blocking the `apps` job if any check fails.

## CD integration

In `.github/workflows/cd.yml`, the `build` job runs `node scripts/migration-gate.js`
before building artifacts.  Additionally, the `deploy` job runs
`npm run migration:run` on the remote host **before** restarting the application
process, ensuring the schema is updated before any new code serves traffic.

## Rollback guidance

If a migration fails on production:

1. **Do not edit the existing migration** — it may already be partially applied.
2. Create a new compensating migration that reverses the change.
3. Apply the compensating migration: `npm run backend:migration:run`.
4. Verify the readiness probe returns 200: `curl https://<host>/api/health/ready`.
5. Re-deploy the previous application version if the schema change is
   incompatible with the current app version.

## Assumptions & follow-up work

- The gate does not connect to a live database.  It only performs static
  analysis of migration files.
- Online migration locking (advisory locks, `pg_try_advisory_lock`) and
  backward-compatibility validation against a test database are follow-up items.
- Cross-directory duplicate timestamp detection (between `migrations/` and
  `src/migrations/`) is not enforced because TypeORM resolves ordering by
  class name in that case.
