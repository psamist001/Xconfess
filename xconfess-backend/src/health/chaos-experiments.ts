/**
 * Chaos experiment catalogue for xConfess.
 *
 * Each experiment follows the standard hypothesis-driven format:
 *
 *   hypothesis  — what we expect the system to do
 *   abort       — condition that stops the experiment immediately
 *   metrics     — what to observe during the run
 *   remediation — issue / action to file when the experiment fails
 *
 * All experiments are STAGING-ONLY.  The `validate()` helper refuses to
 * run if it detects a production environment (DATABASE_URL matches
 * production patterns or NODE_ENV === 'production').
 *
 * Running experiments:
 *   node scripts/run-chaos-experiment.js --experiment=<id>
